## Two types of sex chromosome constitutions
Across the animal kingdom, there are two major types of heterogametic sex chromosome constitutions: **XX/XY** and **WZ/ZZ**. 

In the XX/XY systems, such as flies, worms and mammals, the male is the heterogametic sex and bears a pair of heterogametic/heteromorphic sex chromosomes (XY), while the female is the homogametic sex and carries a pair of homomorphic sex chromosomes (XX).

In the WZ/ZZ systems, which includes birds, snakes and some fish, the sex role is reversed: females are the heterogametic sex with WZ chromosomes while males carry ZZ chromosomes.

## How did sex chromosomes evolve?
Sex chrosomes evolves from a regular pair of autosomes (**proto-sex chromosomes**). 

When one of the chromosome pair (the proto-Y\|W), acquired a sex determining locus, sexually antagonistic alleles started to accumulate around that locus. This caused recombination to cease and overtime, the whole  Y\|W started to degenerate, ultimately ended up highly heterochromatinized.
> A heterochromatinized Y\|W is filled with repetitive elements and has few, if any, protein-coding genes.

## Peril of hemizygosity
The consequence of the degenerate Y\|W is a "dosage problem" for X\|Z-linked genes: due to the loss of X\|Z gametologs from the Y\|W, sex-linked genes in the heterogametic sex have only half the "doze" of those in the homogametic sex and autosomal genes. Because gene copy number often (not always) correlates with transcriotional levels, this chromosome-scale imbalance in gene dosage could detrimentally disrupt gene expression networks between sex-linked and autosomal genes, as is typically observed for aneuploidies. 

## SCDC recapitulates *"ancestral dosage"*
Theory predicts that SCDC mechanisms would evolve to rescue the individual from this "peril of hemizygosity", by restoring X\|Z-linked transcription to the ancestral levels on the proto-sex chromosomes (i.e., before the differentiation of heteromorphic sex chromosomes). 

## "Dosage compensation" vs "dosage balance"
There are two outcomes of SCDC: equilibrated expression between sex chromosome and the autosomes in the heterogametic sex, which we call _dosage compensation_ in its strict sense. Meanwhile, SCDC also balances sex-linked expression between sexes, and we specifically call this _dosage balance_. This distinct is useful in catagorizing different SCDC patterns in a more nuanced* way (see below).

Traditionally "complete dosage compensation" were used to describe SCDC patterns that involves global mechanisms (“Drosophila-like” SCDC and “nematode-like” SCDC, see below), while "incomplete dosage compensation" was reserved for those lacking one ("avian-like" SCDC). However, I argue that such use, while convenient, can be misleading and conflating the two very different processes/mechanisms leading to "compensation" vs "balance" (see below).

## Three primary modes of SCDC
Different species deal with dosage problems differently. Based on distinctions in "compensation" and "balance", we typically observe three modes of SCDC. 
* “Drosophila-like” SCDC: full compensation & full balance (XY=XX=AA)

In this type, both dosage balance and complete compensation are achieved via regulation only in the heterogametic sex: the single X copy in males is hypertranscribed by two-fold while the XX females are not affected. Therefore, both compensation and balane are achieve via a single mechanism. This type of SCDC has so far only been reported among XX/XY species (the sole exception is the neo-Z segment in the monarch butterfly, read more in [SCDC in Lepidoptera](./lepdc.md)).

* “nematode-like” SCDC: partial or little compensation & full balance (XY=XX<AA)
This type of SCDC is best represented by nematodes and therian mammals. The SCDC mechanisms involve both sexes. Biallelic X transcription in the homogametic sex is downregulated to equalize expression with the single X copy in the heterogametic male, either by partially repressing both X copies (nematodes) or silencing one of them (mammals), anf both are mechanisms for dosage balance. 

Unfortunately these dosage balance mechansms, most well-known and most popularly studied, are commonly referred to as "dosage compensation" by most researcher and to draw parallel with _Drosophila_.

Meanwhile, limited X up-regulation in both sexes leaves the X with overall reduced expression relative to autosomes (partial or no compensation). This is the mechanism for dosage compensation, but actually much less studied and overlooked in species with nematode-like SCDC.

“Drosophila-like” and “nematode-like” modes of SCDC are both epigenetically regulated chromosome-wide.

* “avian-like” SCDC: no compensation* or balance (XY<XX=AA)

In contrast to __global mechanisms seen__ in Drosophila-like and nematode-like SCDC, a minority of dosage-sensitive sex-linked loci in species with avian-like SCDC are __locally__ up-regulated in the heterogametic sex while the homogametic expression remains unaffected. As a result, X\|Z-linked gene expression is reduced in the heterogametic sex compared to the homogametic sex and autosomal expression: manifesting a dosage effect.

Interestingly, this kind of SCDC is mostly found among female heterogametic (WZ/ZZ) taxa, and almost all WZ/ZZ taxa examined so far follow avian-like SCDC [3]. But there is a twist: [moths and butterflies are the outliers](./lepdc.md).

## Why is it important to study SCDC?
SCDC represents a fascinating and intricate machinery that regulates gene expression on a global level. Therefore, SCDC holds the keys to answering basic questions on both sex chromosome evolution and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Because SCDC rescues the individual from a case of aneuploidy that would be otherwise harmful or detrimental, it is also of particular interest to the biomedical research field.
