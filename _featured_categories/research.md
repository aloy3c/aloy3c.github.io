My primary research employs multi-level functional genomic tools to address evolutionary questions in a comparative framework. My current focus is on **sex chromosome evolution** and **sex chromosome dosage compensation (SCDC)** in a non-model system: Amphiesmenoptera, which comprises the insect sister orders of Trichoptera (caddisflies) and Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies).


>_**Why study sex chromosomes and SCDC?**_

Sex chromosomes have repeatedly evolved among different plant and animal lineages; they are shaped by unique evolutionary forces while playing a prominent role in evolutionary processes such as speciation, adaptation and genomic conflict. Therefore, sex chromosomes can yield valuable insights into organismal evolutionary history. In particular, evolution of degenerate sex chromosomes also gave rise to SCDC.

SCDC on the other hand, represents fascinating regulatory mechanisms on the epigenetic level that globally restore sex-linked transcription to the ancestral level prior to allosome differentiation. Therefore, SCDC holds the keys to answering basic questions on both sex chromosome evolution and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Because SCDC rescues the individual from a case of aneuploidy that would be otherwise harmful or detrimental, it is also of particular interest to the biomedical research field.
